// TODO: setting to disable persistent buffers on a per-buffer basis

// A single/double/triple-buffered buffer wrapper used internally for graphics. Used to send data to/from the GPU
// With persistently mapped buffers, you still can't write to data being read by the GPU. (i got visual artifacts when i didn't care).
// Because they work asyncronously, this means you need to use double/triple buffering (triple to account for drivers).
// This does double/triple memory footprint, which is why there is a constant to control whether it does single/double/triple buffering.
// Sorry for the bad name.
// TODO: for persistently mapped buffers on platforms that don't support them, we can just make it call glBufferData when Commit() is called.
